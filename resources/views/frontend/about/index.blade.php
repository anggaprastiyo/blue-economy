                <h3>What is the SSF Hub?</h3>
                <p>The Small-Scale Fisheries Resource and Collaboration Hub is an online, interactive, and multilingual platform for small-scale fishers, fish workers, and their communities and allies. It provides access to free tools and resources to strengthen small-scale fisheries governance and community development. As a collaborative space, the SSF Hub is meant to be used by those working in and with small-scale fishing communities to implement the <a href="http://www.fao.org/voluntary-guidelines-small-scale-fisheries/guidelines/en/" target="_blank" title="Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries"><u>Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication </u></a><a href="http://www.fao.org/voluntary-guidelines-small-scale-fisheries/guidelines/en/" target="_blank" title="Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries">(SSF Guidelines)</a>. </p>
                <p>The SSF Hub is a growing global platform and community to inspire and empower people to elevate the profile of small-scale fisheries on the global agenda and strengthen these fisheries for a better future.</p>
                <p>It will continue to evolve and adapt to the needs of small-scale fishing communities.
